# Event_Registration_App

**1. Set Up a React Project:**
   - Start by creating a new React project using a tool like Create React App (CRA) or your preferred React development environment.

**2. Create Components for Pages:**
   - Develop React components for different pages within the app:
     - Event Listing: Displays a list of upcoming events.
     - Event Details: Provides detailed information about a selected event.
     - Registration Form: Allows users to input their registration details.
     - Confirmation: Shows a confirmation message after successful registration.

**3. Fetch Event Data:**
   - Implement logic to fetch event data from a backend API or database. You can use libraries like Axios or the `fetch` API to make HTTP requests to the backend.

**4. Registration Form:**
   - Create a registration form component using React form libraries like Formik or react-hook-form. The form should include fields for user details such as name, email, phone number, and any other relevant information.

**5. Form Validation:**
   - Implement form validation to ensure that users provide valid data. Validate fields like email addresses, phone numbers, and required fields.

**6. Form Submission:**
   - Handle form submission events and send the registration data to the backend for processing. Use asynchronous requests (e.g., POST requests) to send data to the server.

**7. Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to gracefully handle situations where the registration fails. Display error messages to the user when needed.

**8. Data Storage:**
   - Store registration data in a database or backend system. Depending on the backend technology used, this may involve inserting data into a database or handling data storage on the server.

**9. Feedback to User:**
   - After successful registration, provide feedback to the user, such as a confirmation message or a redirection to a confirmation page.

**10. Styling:**
    - Style the app using CSS or styling libraries to create an attractive and user-friendly interface. Pay attention to responsive design to ensure the app works well on different devices.
